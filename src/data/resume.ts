    "Frontend Developer specializing in React, Next.js, and Vue.js. Creating accessible, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.",
  summary: `As a dedicated Frontend Developer, I specialize in building dynamic, accessible, and responsive web applications using React, Next.js, and Vue.js. My expertise includes crafting interfaces that not only look great but also meet the highest standards of accessibility and usability.

Leveraging TypeScript and modern design patterns, I ensure that the applications I create are scalable, maintainable, and robust.

Beyond technical development, I have a strong foundation in design principles and UX practices. My experience in these areas allows me to collaborate effectively with designers, creating solutions that seamlessly blend functionality with user experience.

I focus on delivering intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that enhance engagement and leave a lasting impression. For me, frontend development isn't just about writing codeâ€”it's about understanding users, solving problems, and delivering polished, impactful products that align with both business and user goals.`,
